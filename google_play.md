# Google Play

> [!WARNING]  
> microG probably should not be used.  They have a proper store and services built into GrapheneOS.

> [!WARNING]  
> Installing Zygisk to hide root is not reccomended on GrapheneOS.  It can and does break and then it takes a while to get fixed since the maintainers do not like GrapheneOS.  I also tried it and it didn't work.

## Installing Google Play

In the GrapheneOS app store install Google Play Store which will also install Google Play Services automatically.

## Notes/Warnings regarding Goole Play on rooted GrapheneOS

Some apps will not work in a non Google/rooted environment.  Especialy financial, streaming, automotive, gaming, and some eSIM apps (including Airalo).  Some won't even show up in the play store.

You can try using the Aurora store which will allow apps to be installed but they may or may not work.  Airalo is an example of something that will install and not work.  Saily is an example of an app that won't install from the Play store but does from Aurora and it does work.
