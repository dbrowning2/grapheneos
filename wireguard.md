# Wireguard

Download https://f-droid.org/F-Droid.apk

Install it
```
adb install F-Droid.apk
```

When prompted for install rights grant them.  I only used the top option.

Go to the `Updates` tab and make sure it has downloaded repo info.

Search for `Obtanium` and install it.

Add an app using this URL:

https://download.wireguard.com/android-client/

Wireguard will be automatically installed and updated as new releases come out.
