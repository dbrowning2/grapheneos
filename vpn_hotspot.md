# VPN Hospot

GrapheneOS does not expose the option to tunnel over VPN.

In F-Droid search for `VPN Hotspot` and install it.

Make sure you connect to VPN then in `VPN Hotspot` choose the `Wi-Fi hotspot` option, grant privileges when asked.  To enable tunneling over VPN select the wlan interface above it.
